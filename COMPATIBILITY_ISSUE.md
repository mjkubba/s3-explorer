# Compatibility Issues

## Current Problems

The project is facing several compatibility issues:

1. **API Changes in AWS SDK**: The AWS SDK for Rust has undergone significant API changes between versions. Our code was written for a newer version than what we're currently using.

2. **API Changes in egui/eframe**: The egui GUI framework has also changed its API structure between versions.

3. **Windows Resource Compilation**: The build script is trying to compile Windows resources but is encountering issues with the icon file.

## Specific Issues

### AWS SDK Issues:
- `aws_sdk_s3::primitives::ByteStream` path has changed
- `aws_config::credentials::Credentials` path has changed
- `aws_sdk_s3::types::HeadObjectOutput` path has changed
- Type mismatch between `aws_sdk_s3::types::DateTime` and `chrono::DateTime<Utc>`

### egui/eframe Issues:
- `eframe::CreationContext` not found
- `eframe::App` trait not found
- `eframe::Frame` not found
- `eframe::Error` not found
- `egui::ViewportCommand` not found

### Other Issues:
- Missing `try_next()` method for `ByteStream`
- Unsized type issues with `[u8]`
- `Clone` trait not implemented for `Box<dyn Fn(TransferProgress) + Send>`

## Solution Options

1. **Update Code to Match Current API Versions**:
   - Update AWS SDK usage to match version 0.24.0
   - Update egui/eframe usage to match version 0.17.0

2. **Pin Dependencies to Specific Versions**:
   - Use exact versions that match our code

3. **Rewrite Problematic Sections**:
   - Rewrite the file transfer logic to use the current API
   - Rewrite the UI code to use the current egui API

## Next Steps

1. Update the AWS SDK code to match the current API
2. Update the egui/eframe code to match the current API
3. Fix the Windows resource compilation issue
4. Address the `Box<dyn Fn>` clone issue

This will require significant changes to the codebase, but it's necessary to make the application compatible with the current environment.
