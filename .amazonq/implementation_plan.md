# Implementation Plan

## 2025-05-26: Fixed Region-Specific S3 Bucket Access

### Problem
The application was failing to list objects in S3 buckets with a "service error" because it was using the default region (us-east-1) for all bucket operations, regardless of the bucket's actual region. In particular, the bucket "testperms-mj1" is in us-east-2, but the application was trying to access it using a client configured for us-east-1.

### Changes Made
1. Modified `aws_operations.rs` to use region-specific AWS clients when listing bucket objects:
   - Added code to check if the bucket region is known from the bucket view
   - If a region is found, use `get_client_for_region()` instead of the default client
   - Added logging to track which region is being used for each bucket

2. Enhanced error handling in the AWS operations to provide more detailed error information:
   - Created a new `S3ErrorHelper` class to extract and format AWS error details
   - Improved error messages to include AWS error codes and descriptions
   - Added specific guidance for common errors like access denied or invalid credentials

### Benefits
- The application can now correctly access buckets in different AWS regions
- Users get more detailed error messages when operations fail
- Better logging for troubleshooting region-specific issues

### Next Steps
- Test the application with buckets in various regions to verify the fix works
- Consider adding a region selector in the UI for manual region override
- Implement caching of bucket regions to improve performance
