# Implementation Plan for S3Sync

## 2025-05-27: Fixed Local Folder View Issues

### Problem
The local folder view was not working correctly in the Windows environment. The main issues were:

1. The folder dialog functionality was not working properly in the WSL/Windows environment
2. There were borrow checker issues in the code that prevented the folder content from being displayed
3. Error handling for file access was insufficient

### Changes Made

1. Modified `folder_list.rs`:
   - Replaced the threaded folder dialog implementation with a simpler approach that uses a hardcoded path for testing
   - This allows us to verify the rest of the functionality while bypassing the native dialog issues in WSL

2. Modified `folder_content.rs`:
   - Changed the `files()` method to return a cloned vector instead of a reference to avoid borrow checker issues
   - Made the `load_files()` method public so it can be called from the main view renderer
   - Improved error handling to display error messages when files can't be accessed

3. Modified `main_view_renderer.rs`:
   - Fixed borrow checker issues by cloning paths before passing them to methods
   - Added a refresh button to allow users to reload folder contents
   - Improved error messaging when no files are found or access is denied

### Results
The local folder view now works correctly. Users can:
- Add folders (currently using a test path)
- View the contents of the selected folder
- Refresh the folder contents if needed
- See appropriate error messages when issues occur

## 2025-05-27: Implemented Native Folder Selection Dialog

### Problem
The folder selection dialog was using a hardcoded path (home directory) instead of allowing users to select their own folders.

### Changes Made

1. Modified `folder_list.rs`:
   - Implemented a native Windows folder browser dialog using PowerShell
   - Created a PowerShell script that opens the standard Windows folder browser dialog
   - Used a temporary file to communicate the selected path between Windows and WSL
   - Added handling for BOM (Byte Order Mark) characters in the file path

2. Modified `app_impl.rs`:
   - Removed the custom folder dialog UI since we're now using the native Windows dialog

### Results
Users can now:
- Click "Add Folder" to open a standard Windows folder browser dialog
- Select any folder on their system
- See the selected folder's contents in the local folder view
- The application properly handles the selected path, including removing any BOM characters

### Future Improvements
- Add error handling for cases where PowerShell execution fails
- Implement platform-specific folder dialogs for Linux and macOS
- Add a progress indicator while the folder dialog is open
