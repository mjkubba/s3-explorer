# Implementation Plan

## 2025-05-24: Initial Build and Fixes

1. Added missing `winres` dependency to the project
   - Added as a build dependency with `cargo add winres --build`
   - This is needed for embedding Windows resources like icons in the executable

2. Fixed AWS authentication issue
   - Modified the AWS credentials provider in `src/aws/auth.rs`
   - Changed the service name from "s3sync" to "s3sync-app" to avoid header validation issues
   - This fixed the `InvalidHeaderValue` error that was occurring during runtime

3. Enhanced the bucket selection UI
   - Added a dropdown menu for bucket selection in `src/ui/bucket_view.rs`
   - Improved the user experience by making bucket selection more intuitive
   - Kept the original list view as a fallback/alternative

4. Implemented automatic credential loading
   - Modified the application to load AWS credentials from the system keyring on startup
   - Updated the `Default` implementation for `S3SyncApp` to check for saved credentials
   - Added proper communication between threads for bucket list updates
   - Improved the UI flow for connecting to AWS and selecting buckets

5. Added bucket content display
   - Implemented functionality to display S3 bucket contents in the main view
   - Added visual indicators for files and folders (directories)
   - Displayed object sizes for better information
   - Fixed UI element ID clashes by using egui's Frame component to isolate UI elements

## 2025-05-25: Code Refactoring and Bug Fixes

1. Refactored the application structure to improve maintainability
   - Split the large app.rs file into multiple smaller files:
     - app_state.rs: Contains the application state structure
     - app_impl.rs: Contains the implementation of the S3SyncApp
     - aws_operations.rs: Contains AWS-related operations
     - utils.rs: Contains utility functions like format_size

2. Fixed AWS integration issues
   - Added initialize() method to AwsAuth for proper AWS client initialization
   - Fixed TransferManager to properly list buckets and objects
   - Fixed date formatting issues with S3 object timestamps

3. Further refactored the UI code for better organization
   - Created specialized renderer components:
     - main_view_renderer.rs: Renders the main application view
     - settings_view_renderer.rs: Renders the settings view
     - filter_view_renderer.rs: Renders the filter view
     - menu_bar_renderer.rs: Renders the application menu bar
     - status_bar_renderer.rs: Renders the status bar

4. Improved code organization
   - Created a cleaner separation of concerns between UI and business logic
   - Made the application more modular for easier maintenance
   - Preserved all existing functionality while improving the structure

## Next Steps

1. Address the numerous warnings by cleaning up unused imports and dead code
2. Implement object selection and actions (download, delete)
3. Add file upload functionality from local folders to S3 buckets
4. Implement sync operations between local folders and S3 buckets
5. Add filtering capabilities for objects and files
6. Implement progress tracking for operations
