# Implementation Plan

## 2025-05-24: Initial Build and Fixes

1. Added missing `winres` dependency to the project
   - Added as a build dependency with `cargo add winres --build`
   - This is needed for embedding Windows resources like icons in the executable

2. Fixed AWS authentication issue
   - Modified the AWS credentials provider in `src/aws/auth.rs`
   - Changed the service name from "s3sync" to "s3sync-app" to avoid header validation issues
   - This fixed the `InvalidHeaderValue` error that was occurring during runtime

3. Enhanced the bucket selection UI
   - Added a dropdown menu for bucket selection in `src/ui/bucket_view.rs`
   - Improved the user experience by making bucket selection more intuitive
   - Kept the original list view as a fallback/alternative

4. Implemented automatic credential loading
   - Modified the application to load AWS credentials from the system keyring on startup
   - Updated the `Default` implementation for `S3SyncApp` to check for saved credentials
   - Added proper communication between threads for bucket list updates
   - Improved the UI flow for connecting to AWS and selecting buckets

5. Added bucket content display
   - Implemented functionality to display S3 bucket contents in the main view
   - Added visual indicators for files and folders (directories)
   - Displayed object sizes for better information
   - Fixed UI element ID clashes by using egui's Frame component to isolate UI elements

## Next Steps

1. Implement object selection and actions (download, delete)
2. Add file upload functionality from local folders to S3 buckets
3. Implement sync operations between local folders and S3 buckets
4. Add filtering capabilities for objects and files
5. Implement progress tracking for operations
6. Clean up unused imports and address warnings
