# Cross-Compilation Notes for S3Sync

## Current Compilation Errors

When attempting to compile on Linux, the following errors were encountered:

1. **Type Mismatch in AWS SDK Client Initialization**:
   ```
   error[E0308]: mismatched types
   --> src/sync/engine.rs:258:92
       |
   258 |         let engine = SyncEngine::new(TransferManager::new(Arc::new(aws_sdk_s3::Client::new(&aws_sdk_s3::Config::builder().build()))));
       |                                                                    ----------------------- ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `&SdkConfig`, found `&Config`
   ```

   The AWS SDK client initialization is using incorrect types. The `Client::new()` function expects a `&SdkConfig` but is being provided with a `&aws_sdk_s3::Config`.

2. **Multiple Unused Imports**:
   Several unused imports were detected across multiple files, which should be cleaned up.

## Cross-Compilation Considerations

### Windows to Linux
- **Path Separators**: Windows uses backslashes (`\`) while Linux uses forward slashes (`/`). Use platform-agnostic path handling with `std::path`.
- **File Permissions**: Different between Windows and Linux, ensure proper handling.
- **Dependencies**: Some dependencies may have platform-specific features or requirements.
- **GUI Rendering**: eframe/egui may have platform-specific considerations.

### Linux to Windows
- **Build Tools**: Ensure proper Windows build tools are installed.
- **Dependencies**: Some Linux-specific dependencies may need Windows alternatives.
- **File System Access**: Windows has different file system access patterns.

### macOS Considerations
- **Dependencies**: Some dependencies may require specific macOS versions.
- **Keychain Access**: macOS uses Keychain for credential storage, which differs from Windows and Linux solutions.

## Recommended Cross-Compilation Setup

1. **Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD**:
   - Set up workflows for each target platform
   - Automate testing on different platforms

2. **Docker for Consistent Builds**:
   - Create Docker images for build environments
   - Ensure consistent dependency versions

3. **Platform-Specific Code**:
   - Use conditional compilation with `#[cfg(target_os = "...")]`
   - Abstract platform-specific functionality behind common interfaces

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Unit tests should run on all platforms
   - Integration tests may need platform-specific configurations

## Immediate Fix for Current Errors

For the AWS SDK client initialization error:
```rust
// Replace:
aws_sdk_s3::Client::new(&aws_sdk_s3::Config::builder().build())

// With:
let sdk_config = aws_config::from_env().load().await;
aws_sdk_s3::Client::new(&sdk_config)
```

Note: This will require making the function async or using a runtime block if in a synchronous context.
