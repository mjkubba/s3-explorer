## Focus
Focus on the problem at hand, don't change multiple files add or remove funtionality unless asked,
Always create and update implemetation_plan.md with what was done, try to preserve what you can on that file to track what was changed and when.

## Ask questions
For anything that not clear or ambiguous please ask clarification questions, before proceeding. also ask questions before changing plans or removing functionality even if that is for testing
