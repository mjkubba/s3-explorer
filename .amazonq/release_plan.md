# S3Sync Release Plan

## Current Status
- Project: S3Sync - A Cross-Platform GUI Tool for AWS S3 File Synchronization
- Current Version: 0.1.0
- Updated Version: 0.5.0
- Repository Status: Clean working tree, but with compilation errors

## Pre-Release Tasks

### 1. Fix Compilation Errors
- **AWS SDK Client Initialization**: Update the client initialization in `src/sync/engine.rs` to use the correct SDK config type
- **Clean up unused imports**: Remove or comment out unused imports across the codebase

### 2. Update Version Number
- ✅ Update version in Cargo.toml from 0.1.0 to 0.5.0
- Update any version references in the code (if applicable)

### 3. Create Documentation
- ✅ Create CHANGELOG.md with initial release notes
- Document known issues or limitations

## Release Process

### 1. Local Release Build
```bash
# Run tests after fixing compilation errors
cargo test

# Build the release version with optimizations
cargo build --release

# Test the built binary
./target/release/s3sync
```

### 2. Git Release Process
```bash
# Commit version changes and fixes
git add .
git commit -m "chore(release): prepare v0.5.0 release"

# Create a git tag for the release
git tag -a v0.5.0 -m "Version 0.5.0"

# Push changes and tags to GitHub
git push origin main
git push origin v0.5.0
```

### 3. GitHub Release Process
1. Navigate to the GitHub repository
2. Click on "Releases" in the right sidebar
3. Click "Create a new release"
4. Select the tag "v0.5.0"
5. Set the release title to "S3Sync v0.5.0"
6. Copy the content from CHANGELOG.md into the description
7. Upload the built binaries for different platforms:
   - Windows: `s3sync.exe`
   - Linux: `s3sync` (if cross-compiled)
   - macOS: `s3sync` (if cross-compiled)
8. Check "This is a pre-release" if appropriate
9. Click "Publish release"

## Cross-Platform Considerations

For future releases, consider setting up a proper cross-compilation pipeline:

1. **Windows Build**:
   - Already working in the current environment

2. **Linux Build**:
   - Requires fixing the current compilation errors
   - Consider using Docker or GitHub Actions

3. **macOS Build**:
   - Will require access to macOS environment
   - Consider using GitHub Actions with macOS runners

## Post-Release Tasks

1. Update documentation if needed
2. Announce the release through appropriate channels
3. Plan for the next development cycle
4. Address any feedback from early users
