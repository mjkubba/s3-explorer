# AWS Authentication Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Created Missing S3 Module**
   - Added `src/aws/s3.rs` with the `S3Object` struct
   - Updated `src/aws/mod.rs` to include the new module

2. **Fixed Mutex Threading Issues**
   - Modified code to avoid holding `MutexGuard` across await points
   - Changed pattern from:
     ```rust
     let result = {
         let mut auth = auth_clone.lock().unwrap();
         auth.test_credentials().await
     };
     ```
   - To:
     ```rust
     let mut auth = {
         let guard = auth_clone.lock().unwrap();
         guard.clone()
     };
     let result = auth.test_credentials().await;
     ```

3. **Fixed Progress Callback Type Mismatches**
   - Attempted to fix the `Send + Sync` requirements for callbacks

## Remaining Issues

1. **Type Mismatches Between S3Object Types**
   - There are two different `S3Object` structs:
     - `crate::aws::s3::S3Object` (newly created)
     - `crate::ui::bucket_view::S3Object` (existing)
   - Need to consolidate these or update code to use the correct type

2. **Missing UI Component Methods**
   - Many methods referenced in app.rs are not implemented in their respective components
   - For example, `ProgressView` is missing methods like `show`, `update_progress`, etc.

3. **CredentialManager Default Implementation**
   - Need to implement `Default` trait for `CredentialManager`

4. **Unsized Type Issues**
   - Issues with `str` and `Path` types in for loops

## Next Steps

1. Consolidate the `S3Object` types to use a single definition
2. Implement the missing UI component methods
3. Add `Default` implementation for `CredentialManager`
4. Fix the remaining type issues in the for loops

## Code Changes Made

1. Added `src/aws/s3.rs` with `S3Object` implementation
2. Updated `src/aws/mod.rs` to include the s3 module
3. Fixed mutex handling in async blocks to avoid holding locks across await points
4. Attempted to fix progress callback boxing issues
