# S3Sync Application Specification

## Project Overview
- **Name**: S3Sync
- **Purpose**: A Windows GUI application that allows users to easily sync local folders to AWS S3 buckets
- **Target Users**: Windows users looking for a simple backup solution

## Core Features

### 1. Folder Selection
- Select one or more local folders for syncing
- Save/remember previously selected folders
- Display sync status for each folder (synced, pending, error)
- Visual indication of sync status (icons/colors)

### 2. S3 Bucket Management
- Connect to AWS S3 using user credentials
- Select destination bucket(s)
- Create new buckets if needed
- View bucket contents
- Map local folders to specific bucket paths

### 3. Sync Operations
- Upload new/modified files
- Delete files from S3 that were deleted locally (optional toggle)
- Download files from S3 to local folders
- Show sync progress and status
- Support for large files with multipart upload
- Resume interrupted uploads

### 4. Settings & Configuration
- AWS credentials management (access key, secret key)
- Region selection
- Sync frequency options (manual, scheduled)
- File filtering options (include/exclude patterns)
- Bandwidth throttling
- Conflict resolution strategies

## Technical Specifications

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Rust
- **GUI Framework**: To be decided (egui, iced, or Tauri)
- **AWS SDK**: aws-sdk-rust
- **Storage**: Local config files for settings (encrypted for credentials)

### System Requirements
- **OS**: Windows 10/11
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Rust runtime
  - AWS credentials
- **Minimum Hardware**: 
  - 4GB RAM
  - 100MB disk space (excluding synced files)

- Status bar (bottom)
- Action buttons (top)

### Settings Dialog
- AWS configuration tab
- Sync preferences tab
- Advanced options tab

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup & Basic UI (2 weeks)
- Project initialization with Rust and chosen GUI framework
- Create basic UI layout with folder selection
- Implement AWS credential configuration
- Basic settings storage

### Phase 2: S3 Integration (2 weeks)
- Implement AWS S3 connection
- Add bucket listing and selection
- Basic file upload functionality
- Error handling for AWS operations

### Phase 3: Sync Logic (3 weeks)
- Implement file comparison logic
- Add upload/download/delete operations
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Conflict detection and resolution

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (2 weeks)
- Scheduled syncs
- File filtering
- Bandwidth controls
- Error handling and recovery

### Phase 5: Testing & Refinement (2 weeks)
- Cross-platform testing
- Performance optimization
- User experience improvements
- Bug fixes

## Security Considerations
- Secure storage of AWS credentials
- HTTPS for all AWS API calls
- Minimal permission requirements (IAM policy templates)
- No collection of user data beyond necessary configuration

## Future Enhancements
- Cloud-to-cloud sync
- File versioning support
- Encryption options for sensitive data
- Mobile companion app
- Command-line interface for automation

## Success Metrics
- Successful sync operations
- Error rate below 0.1%
- User retention
- Sync performance (files per minute)
